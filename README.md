# Predicting NBA MVP using ML methods.

### Introduction

This academic project aimed to predict NBA MVP using ML methods thanks to various statistics. But the goal were not to predict only the winner, but all the leaderboard. To did that, we used statictics of players between 1982 and 2017 and we added statictics of their team. \
To get more details about this work : https://github.com/coni26/NBA-MVP/blob/master/README.md

### Method

We used several methods to get best results as possible. \
Finally our method is :
* To apply a function in order to give more importance to players classed in the end of leaderboard
* To oversample players classed in MVP with gaussian noise
* To use random forest on dataset

### Results

With our best model, we get more than 80% of success to predict the good MVP, and 20% the good first three players in the good order.
